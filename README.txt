Expect-like framework

This is a simple implementation of `expect` to help building unitary testing
of interactive program.

It helps to receive question and send answers from an interactive process.
You can match the question using a regular expression (Str). You can also use
a timeout to ensure that the process answer in time.

See the [Expect manual](http://expect.nist.gov/) for more information and
example.

See the files INSTALL.txt for building and installation instructions. See the
file COPYING.txt for copying conditions.
